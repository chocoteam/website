Choco is a Free Open-Source Java library dedicated to Constraint Programming.<br> 
The user models its problem in a declarative way by stating the set of constraints </br>
that need to be satisfied in every solution.<br>
Then, the problem is solved by alternating constraint filtering algorithms with a search mechanism.
