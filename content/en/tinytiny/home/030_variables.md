# Variables and domains

---

## Let's make it simple
A variable will be referenced by a key, its name.

A domain will be associated to it.</br>
<br/>
{{% warn c="Beware:" %}}  each value can appear only once.

---
A dictionary and sets will do :

A dictionary and sets will do :

```python
variables = {"x1": {1, 2, 3},
             "x2": {1, 2, 3}}
```

### and that's enough.

## :rocket: Possible improvements

- Creating a variable object
- Effective domain representation (_e.g._, bitset)
- Introducing variable views (_e.g._, $y = a.x + b$)
- Other types of variable (_e.g._, Boolean, set, graph)
