The CD-CL framework is an adapation of the well-konw SAT [CDCL algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conflict-driven_clause_learning) to discrete constraint solver.
By exploiting the implication graph (that records events, i.e. variables' modifications), this algorithm is able to derive a new constraint from the events that led to a contradiction. 

Once added to the constraint network, this constraint makes possible to "backjump" (non-chronological backtrack) to the appropriate decision in the decision path.

In CP, learned constraints are denoted "signed-clauses" which is a disjunction of signed-literals, *i.e.* membership unary constraints : $\bigvee_{i = 0}^{n} X_i \in D_{i}$ where $X_i$ are variables and $D_i$ a set of values.
A signed-clause is satisfied when at least one signed-literal is satisfied. 

#### Warning #### 

> In CP, CDCL algorithm requires that each constraint of a problem can be explained. Even though a default explanation function for any constraint, dedicated functions offers better performances. 
> In `choco-solver` a few set of constraints is equiped with dedicated explanation function (unary constraints, binary and ternary, sum and scalar). 


### RCPSP
The Resource-Constrained Project Scheduling Problem (RCPSP) is a well-known optimization problem in project management. It involves scheduling a set of activities or tasks, each with a specific duration and resource requirements, while considering limited resources availability.

In RCPSP, the goal is to find an optimal or near-optimal schedule that minimizes the project's duration or cost, while respecting resource constraints. These constraints typically include limitations on the availability of resources such as workers, machines, or materials. Activities cannot be scheduled simultaneously if they require the same resource, and the overall schedule must ensure that resource capacities are not exceeded at any given time.

The problem becomes more complex when considering dependencies between activities, where some activities must be completed before others can start. The objective is to create a feasible schedule that meets all constraints and completes the project as quickly and efficiently as possible.

Here is an instance for 30 activities.
Note that two dummy activities are added, a source (1) and a sink (32), for successors declaration.
Neither of them consumes any resources.

Indeed, each of the 36 failures is derived into a new signed-clause which helps reducing the search space.
Since the enumeration strategy is static, so the 2nd search space is ensured to be strictly included in the 1st one. 

#### Remark ####
> The model can be improved by using stronger filtering algorithms than `Cumulative.Filter.NAIVETIME` for the CUMULATIVE constraint. But, the current implementation of the CDCL framework in choco does not support them.


## Limitations ##

One may noticed that, in comparison to the no-CDCL approach, very few nodes can be explored per second.
This is due to the application of the CDCL algorithm which globally slows down the resolution process.
Indeed:
1. Events need to be recorded in the implication graph.
2. New operations are executed on each conflict to derive a signed-clauses. 
3. The number of learned signed-clauses increases w.r.t. the number of conflict, this can slow down the propagation step (reaching a fix-point or detecting a new conflict).

The last point is probably the most expensive one. That's why, from time to time, some learned clauses need to be forgotten (in `DefaultSettings`: every 100000 failures, half of them are removed under conditions).
Beware, removing a learned sign may not be inconsequential.
For example, the "same" contradiction can thrown again in the future, or the enumeration strategy may be impacted.

In conclusion, CDCL can be very powerful in reducing search space. 
However, this reduction sometimes does not compensate the algorithm cost it comes with.
