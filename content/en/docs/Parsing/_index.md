# Modelling languages

Choco-solver is able to parse and solve instances in different modelling languages.
The main language is the Choco-solver modelling language, which is a Java-based language.
It is a high-level language that allows to define constraints and variables in a very concise way.

In addition, Choco-solver is able to parse and solve instances in other languages.
The two most common languages are [MiniZinc](https://www.minizinc.org/) and [XCSP3](https://xcsp.org/competitions/).
Choco-solver is also able to parse and solve instances in [DIMACS](https://jix.github.io/varisat/manual/0.2.0/formats/dimacs.html) format.
