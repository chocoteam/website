that we do not develop

## At the modelling level

- Other kinds of variables
- Other constraints or way to express rules
- Search space exploration
	- Black-box strategies,
	- Restarting,
	- Alternatives to DFS
---

## At the solving step

- Refine the way constraints are propagated
- Fine response of propagators to variables' changes
- Restore by copy or trail
- Conflict-driven Clause-learning
- ...

---

And so many other things !
