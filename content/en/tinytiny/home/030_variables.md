# Variables and domains

---

Let's make it simple.</br>
</br>
A variable will be referenced by a key, its name.

---

A domain will be associated to it.</br>
{{% warn c="Beware:" %}}  each value can appear only once.

---

A dictionary and sets will do :

```python{}
variables = {"x1": {1, 2, 3},
             "x2": {1, 2, 3}}
```

### and that's enough.
