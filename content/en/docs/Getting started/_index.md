  Get started with Choco-solver.

## Quick start

Interested in using Choco-solver in your project?
Choco-solver is available as a Java library or a Python package.

### Java
The only prerequisite for running Choco-solver is to have Java (Oracle JRE 11 or OpenJDK 11) installed on your machine.
We strongly recommend to use a build automation tool, like Maven or Gradle, but adding manually the JAR file to the classpath is still an option.


#### Maven 3+

Copy-paste the artifact description to your `pom.xml`:

{{< highlight xml >}}
<dependency>
   <groupId>org.choco-solver</groupId>
   <artifactId>choco-solver</artifactId>
   <version>{{< param "choco_version" >}}</version>
</dependency>
{{< /highlight >}}

To test snapshot release, you should update your `pom.xml` with :

{{< highlight xml >}}
<repository>
    <id>sonatype</id>
    <url>https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots/</url>
    <snapshots>
        <enabled>true</enabled>
    </snapshots>
</repository>
{{< /highlight >}}

#### Gradle 6+

Copy-paste the dependency declaration in your `build.gradle`:

{{< highlight groovy >}}
repositories {
    mavenCentral()
}

dependencies {
    implementation 'org.choco-solver:choco-solver:{{< param "choco_version" >}}'
}
{{< /highlight >}}

#### As a stand-alone application

When one wants to manually add choco-solver as a dependency of a project, they should pay attention to the following:

- In the latest version, the library is available as a single JAR file that defines what is necessary and sufficient to model and solve problems programmatically and includes additional functions to parse FlatZinc, XCSP3, DIMACS or MPS files directly.
- The archive is released with dependencies. If one wants an archive without any dependencies, it is recommended to use Maven or Gradle.
- Finally, the [javadoc](https://javadoc.io/doc/org.choco-solver/choco-solver/latest/org.chocosolver/module-summary.html) of each version is also available on line.

The next step is simply to add the jar file to the classpath of your application and eventually the javadoc.

### Python

We automatically build 64-bit wheels for Python versions 3.6, 3.7, 3.8, 3.9, and 3.10 on Linux, Windows and MacOSX. They can be directly downloaded from PyPI:

```bash
pip install pychoco
```
